Ansible
--------------
Ansible is an open source configuration management tool created using python
Setup
==========
1 Create 4-5 Aws ubuntu-14 instances
2 Name the 1st one as controller and the remaining as Server1 etc
3 The main machine where ansible is installed is called as controler 
  and the remote servers that we configure using ansible are called managed   nodes or managed hosts
4 Ansible uses "agentless" policy to configure remote servers.ie we need not   install any ansible client s/w on the managed nodes.It only requires   passwordless ssh between the controller and the managed nodes
5 Setup passwordless ssh between controller and managed nodes
6 Open terminal in controlelr machine
  Install ansible
  a) Update the apt repository
     sudo apt-get update
  b) Install software-properties-common
     sudo apt-get install -y software-properties-common
  c) Add the latest version of ansible to the apt repository
     sudo apt-add-repository ppa:ansible/ansible
  d) Update the apt repository
     sudo apt-get update
  e) Install ansible
     sudo apt-get install -y ansible

7 Ansible stores all the remote managed node info in a file called
  inventory file which is /etc/ansible/hosts.In this file we should enter the   ipaddress of all the managed nodes
  sudo vim /etc/ansible/hosts
  Enter ipaddress of managed nodes
  Save and quit


ansible can perform remote configuration of servers in the below 3 ways
1 Adhoc commands
2 Ansible playbooks
3 Ansible roles

ansible all/groupname/ipaddress  -i path_of_inventory_file 
                                            -m command     -a '    '


Ansible command to see the memory info of all managed nodes
ansible all -i /etc/ansible/hosts -m command -a 'free'

Note: /etc/ansible/hosts is the default inventory file and it is not necessary to give -i option when we use this default inventory file

ansible all  -m command -a 'free'

Note: command module is the deafult module in ansible and its not necessary to give -m when using this modules

ansible all  -a 'free'

==============================================
ansible command to execute ps -aux and store the output into file1 on the managed nodes
ansible all -m shell -a 'ps -aux > file1'

Ansible command to install docker on all the managed nodes
ansible all -m shell -a 'curl -fsSL https://get.docker.com -o get-docker.sh'
ansible all -m shell -a 'sh get-docker.sh'
